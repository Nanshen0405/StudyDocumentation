## 1.4、阅读理解的变化

> 概述

该部分由A、B、C、D四节组成，考察考生理解书面英语的能力。

- A节（10题）：考察考生理解文章的具体信息、主旨要义、进行推理和引申等能力。要根据所提供的2篇文章的内容（每片平均约350个单词），从每题所给的4个选择项中选出最佳选项。
- B节（5题）：考察考生理解段落主旨要义的能力。要求考生从7个选择项中排除2个干扰项，正确地概括与5段文字（总长约350个单词）逐一搭配成对。
- C节（5题）：考察考生理解文章结构及单句之间、段落之间关系的能力。在篇文章中留出5处空白，要求考生从文后所给的7句话中选出分别能放进文章中空白处的5句，使得补足后的文章意思通顺、前后连贯
- D节（10题）：考察考生对话篇中词汇意义与用法的掌握情况以及对语篇连贯的理解，在一篇200-250词的文章中留出10处空白，要求考生从文后所给的15个单词中选出分别能放进文章中空白处的10个，使得补足后的文章意思通顺，前后连贯



## 1.5、分数权重的计算

为处理好考试中题目数量、赋分与各种技能的考察关系，PETS第三级笔试采用了分数权重制，即对各部分题目的原始赋分分别给予不同的权重，使之能够平衡各种技能的考察关系。

PETS-3采用分数加权的方法，其中听力权重30%，阅读权重40%，写作权重30%，合计100%



==实际分数 = 卷面得分数  / 该部分原始赋分数 * 权重==



如：某考生

听力部分原始得分为20分，经过加权处理后的分数应该为24分 （20 / 25 * 30）= 24

阅读理解原始得分为20分，经过加权处理后的分数应该为32分 （20 / 25 * 40）= 32

写作原始得分为16分，经过加权处理后的分数应该为16分 （16 / 30 * 30）= 16



## 1.6、备考方案

   - 词汇：基础词汇4000词
